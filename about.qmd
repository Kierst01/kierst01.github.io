### Interests

Through my experience as a former competitve swimmer and coach, I realized my passion for athletics. My later work as a nueroscience technician provided me the opprutunity to gather, organize, and disseminate research on biofeedback for the purposes of elevating athletic performance. 

In addition to my professional interests, I enjoy reading, walking Vancouver's local trails, and spending time with friends and family.
