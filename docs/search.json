My later work as a nueroscience technician provided me the opprutunity to gather, organize, and disseminate research on biofeedback for the purposes of elevating athletic performance.\nIn addition to my professional interests, I enjoy reading, walking Vancouver’s local trails, and spending time with friends and family.\n\n\nEducation\nI am completing my Master’s of Data Science in June, after which I am looking to attain a job in the field of data science. This intensive 10-month program has taught me how to formulate questions and use analytical processes to derive insights from data.\nKey Courses: Descriptive Statistics and Probability for Data Science, Statistical Inference and Computation, Regression, Bayesian Statistics, Spatial and Temporal Models, Experimentation and Causal Inference, Supervised Machine Learning, Unsupervised Machine Learning.\n\n\nAchievements\n\n2022 Trek Excellence Scholarship for Continuing Students\n2022 Dean of Science Scholarship\nAchieved the Academic All-Canadian standing from (2016/09) to (2017/04).
