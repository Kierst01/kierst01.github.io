I am a student at the University of British Columbia, currently pursuing my Masters in Data Science. I completed my undergraduate degree at UBC in Integrated Science, combining the disciplines of Neuroscience and Genetics.

I am excited to combine my passion for data science with my background in athletics and find a meanigful role within the field.
